# Lab 1 - Hadoop MapReduce and HDFS
The following steps (Part 1 and Part 2) demonstrate how to install HDFS and build and run "word count" application with Hadoop MapReduce. Then, in Part 3, you are asked to implement a MapReduce code to get the top ten users by their reputation from a list.

## Part 1: HDFS

### Install HDFS

1. Download the Hadoop platform from [here](http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/hadoop/common/hadoop-2.6.4/hadoop-2.6.4.tar.gz).

2. Set the following environment variables.
   ```bash
export JAVA_HOME="<JAVA PATH>"
export HADOOP_HOME="<HADOOP PATH>/hadoop-2.6.4"
export HADOOP_CONFIG="$HADOOP_HOME/etc/hadoop"
   ```

3. Make two folders on local file system, where HDFS namenode and datanode store their data.
   ```bash
mkdir -p $HADOOP_HOME/hdfs/namenode
mkdir -p $HADOOP_HOME/hdfs/datanode
   ```

4. The main HDFS configuration file is located at `$HADOOP_CONFIG/hdfs-site.xml`. Specify the folders path, built in step 4.
   ```xml
<configuration>
  <property>
    <name>dfs.namenode.name.dir</name>
    <value>file:///<HADOOP_HOME>/hdfs/namenode</value>
    <description>Path on the local filesystem where the NameNode stores the namespace and transaction logs persistently.</description>
  </property>

  <property>
    <name>dfs.datanode.data.dir</name>
    <value>file:///<HADOOP_HOME>/hdfs/datanode</value>
    <description>Comma separated list of paths on the local filesystem of a DataNode where it should store its blocks.</description>
  </property>
</configuration>
   ```

5. Specify the URI of the namenode (master) in `$HADOOP_CONFIG/core-site.xml`
   ```xml
<configuration>
  <property>
    <name>fs.defaultFS</name>
    <value>hdfs://127.0.0.1:9000</value>
    <description>NameNode URI</description>
  </property>
</configuration>
   ```

6. Format the namenode directory (DO THIS ONLY ONCE, THE FIRST TIME).
   ```bash
$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hdfs namenode -format
   ```

7. Start the namenode and datanode daemons
   ```bash
$HADOOP_HOME/sbin/hadoop-daemon.sh start namenode
$HADOOP_HOME/sbin/hadoop-daemon.sh start datanode
   ```

### Test HDFS
1. Prints out the HDFS running processes, by running the `jps` command in a terminal.
2. Monitor the process through their web interfaces:
   - Namenode: [http://127.0.0.1:50070](http://127.0.0.1:50070)
   - Datanode: [http://127.0.0.1:50075](http://127.0.0.1:50075)
3. Try HDFS commands </br>


```bash
# Create a new directory /sics on HDFS
$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hdfs dfs -mkdir /sics

# Create a file, call it big, on your local filesystem and upload it to HDFS under /sics.

$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hdfs dfs -put big /sics

# View the content of /sics directory
$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hdfs dfs -ls big /sics

# Determine the size of big on HDFS
$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hdfs dfs -du -h /sics/big

# Print the first 5 lines to screen from big on HDFS
$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hdfs dfs -cat /sics/big | head -n 5

# Copy big to /big hdfscopy on HDFS
$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hdfs dfs -cp /sics/big /sics/big_hdfscopy

# Copy big back to local filesystem and name it big localcopy
$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hdfs dfs -get /sics/big big_localcopy

# Check the entire HDFS filesystem for inconsistencies/problems
$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hdfs fsck /

# Delete big from HDFS
$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hdfs dfs -rm /sics/big

# Delete /sics directory from HDFS
$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hdfs dfs -rm -r /sics
   ```

## Part 2: MapReduce

### Simple Word Count
WordCount is a simple application that counts the number of occurrences of each word in a given input set. Below we will take a look at the mapper and reducer in detail, and then we present the complete code and show how to compile and run it.

#### Word Count Mapper
   ```java
public static class TokenizerMapper extends Mapper<Object, Text, Text, IntWritable> {

  private final static IntWritable one = new IntWritable(1);
  private Text word = new Text();

  public void map(Object key, Text value, Context context) throws IOException, InterruptedException {
    StringTokenizer itr = new StringTokenizer(value.toString());
    while (itr.hasMoreTokens()) {
      word.set(itr.nextToken());
      context.write(word, one);
    }
  }
}

   ```

The `Mapper<Object, Text, Text, IntWritable>` refers to the data type of input and output key-value pairs specific to the mapper or rateher the map method, i.e., `Mapper<Input Key Type, Input Value Type, Output Key Type, Output Value Type>`. In our example, the input to a mapper is a single line, so this Text forms the input value. The input key would a long value assigned in default based on the position of Text in input file. Our output from the mapper is of the format (Word, 1) hence the data type of our output key value pair is `<Text(String),  IntWritable(int)>`.

In the `map` method, the first and second parameter refer to the data type of the input key and value to the mapper. The third parameter is the output collector that does the job of taking the output data. With the output collector we need to specify the data types of the output key and value from the mapper. The fourth parameter is used to report the task status internally in Hadoop environment to avoid time outs.

The functionality of the map method is as follows:

1. Create an `IntWritable` variable `one` with value as 1.

2. Convert the input line in `Text` type to a `String`.

3. Use a tokenizer to split the line into words.

4. Iterate through each word and form key-value pairs as `(word, one)` and push it to the output collector.

#### Word Count Reducer
   ```java
public static class IntSumReducer extends Reducer<Text, IntWritable, Text, IntWritable> {
  private IntWritable result = new IntWritable();

  public void reduce(Text key, Iterable<IntWritable> values, Context context) throws IOException, InterruptedException {
    int sum = 0;
    for (IntWritable val : values) {
      sum += val.get();
    }

    result.set(sum);
    context.write(key, result);
  }
}
   ```

In `Reducer<Text, IntWritable, Text, IntWritable>`, the first two parameters refer to data type of input key and value to the reducer and the last two refer to data type of output key and value. Our mapper emits output as (apple, 1), (grapes, 1), (apple, 1), etc. This is the input for reducer so here the data types of key and value in java would be `String` and `int`, the equivalent in Hadoop would be `Text` and `IntWritable`. Also we get the output as (word, num. of occurrences) so the data type of output Key Value would be `<Text, IntWritable>`.

The input to reduce method from the mapper after the sort and shuffle phase would be the key with the list of associated values with it. For example here we have multiple values for a single key from our mapper like (apple, 1), (apple, 1), (apple, 1). These key-values would be fed into the reducer as (apple, [1, 1, 1]), which is a key and list of values (`Text` key, `Iterator<IntWritable>` values). The next parameter to the `reduce` method denotes the output collector of the reducer with the data type of output key and value.

The functionality of the reduce method is as follows:

1. Initaize a variable `sum` as 0.

2. Iterate through all the values with respect to a key and sum up all of them.

3. Push to the output collector, the key and the obtained sum as value.


#### Driver Class
In addition to mapper and reducer calsses, we need a "driver" class to trigger the MapReduce job in Hadoop. In the driver class we provide the name of the job, output key-value data types and the mapper and reducer classes. Bellow you see the complete code of the "word count":
   ```java
package sics;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.StringTokenizer;

import org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration;
import org.apache.hadoop.fs.Path;
import org.apache.hadoop.io.IntWritable;
import org.apache.hadoop.io.Text;
import org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.Job;
import org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.Mapper;
import org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.Reducer;
import org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.lib.input.FileInputFormat;
import org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.lib.output.FileOutputFormat;

public class WordCount {

  public static class TokenizerMapper extends Mapper<Object, Text, Text, IntWritable> {

    private final static IntWritable one = new IntWritable(1);
    private Text word = new Text();

    public void map(Object key, Text value, Context context) throws IOException, InterruptedException {
      StringTokenizer itr = new StringTokenizer(value.toString());
      while (itr.hasMoreTokens()) {
        word.set(itr.nextToken());
        context.write(word, one);
      }
    }
  }

  public static class IntSumReducer extends Reducer<Text, IntWritable, Text, IntWritable> {
    private IntWritable result = new IntWritable();

    public void reduce(Text key, Iterable<IntWritable> values, Context context) throws IOException, InterruptedException {
      int sum = 0;
      for (IntWritable val : values) {
        sum += val.get();
      }

      result.set(sum);
      context.write(key, result);
    }
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    Configuration conf = new Configuration();
    Job job = Job.getInstance(conf, "word count");
    job.setJarByClass(WordCount.class);

    job.setMapperClass(TokenizerMapper.class);
    job.setCombinerClass(IntSumReducer.class);
    job.setReducerClass(IntSumReducer.class);

    job.setOutputKeyClass(Text.class);
    job.setOutputValueClass(IntWritable.class);

    FileInputFormat.addInputPath(job, new Path(args[0]));
    FileOutputFormat.setOutputPath(job, new Path(args[1]));

    System.exit(job.waitForCompletion(true) ? 0 : 1);
  }
}

   ```

#### Compile and Run The Code
Assume we have two input files, `file0` and `file1`, uploaded on HDFS, and our code reads those files and counts their words.

1. Start the HDFS namenode and datanode (if they are not running). Then create a folder `input` in HDFS, and upload the files in it.
   ```bash
$HADOOP_HOME/sbin/hadoop-daemon.sh start namenode
$HADOOP_HOME/sbin/hadoop-daemon.sh start datanode

$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hdfs dfs -mkdir -p input
$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hdfs dfs -put file0 input/file0
$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hdfs dfs -put file1 input/file1
$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hdfs dfs -ls input
   ```

2. Change directory to the `src` folder and make a target directory, `wordcount_classes`, to keep the compiled files. Then, compile the code and make a final jar file.
   ```bash
cd src

mkdir wordcount_classes

javac -classpath
$HADOOP_HOME/share/hadoop/common/hadoop-common-2.6.4.jar:$HADOOP_HOME/share/hadoop/mapreduce/hadoop-mapreduce-client-core-2.6.4.jar:$HADOOP_HOME/share/hadoop/common/lib/commons-cli-1.2.jar -d wordcount_classes sics/WordCount.java

jar -cvf wordcount.jar -C wordcount_classes/ .
   ```

3. Run the application
   ```bash
$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop jar wordcount.jar sics.WordCount input output
   ```

4. Check the output in HDFS
   ```bash
$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hdfs dfs -ls output
$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hdfs dfs -cat output/part-r-00000
   ```

## Part 3: Top Ten
The input data of this part is in the `topten` folder. Given the list of user information, print out the information of the top ten users based on their reputation. In your code, each mapper determines the top ten records of its input split and outputs them to the reduce phase. The mappers are filtering their input split to the top ten records, and the reducer is responsible for the final ten. Use `setNumReduceTasks` to configure your job to use only one reducer, because multiple reducers would shard the data and would result in multiple top ten lists.

### The Mapper Code
You can use `TreeMap` structure in the mapper to store the processed input records. A `TreeMap` is a subclass of `Map` that sorts on key. After all the records have been processed, the top ten records in the `TreeMap` are output to the reducers in the `cleanup` method. This method gets called once after all key-value pairs have been through map.

   ```java
public static class TopTenMapper extends Mapper<Object, Text, NullWritable, Text> {
  // Stores a map of user reputation to the record
  private TreeMap<Integer, Text> repToRecordMap = new TreeMap<Integer, Text>();

  public void map(Object key, Text value, Context context) throws IOException, InterruptedException {
    Map<String, String> parsed = <FILL IN>
    String userId = <FILL IN>
    String reputation = <FILL IN>

    // Add this record to our map with the reputation as the key
    repToRecordMap.<FILL IN>

    // If we have more than ten records, remove the one with the lowest reputation.
    if (repToRecordMap.size() > 10) {
      <FILL IN>
    }
  }

  protected void cleanup(Context context) throws IOException, InterruptedException {
    // Output our ten records to the reducers with a null key
    for (Text t : repToRecordMap.values()) {
      context.write(NullWritable.get(), t);
    }
  }
}
   ```

### The Reducer Code
The reducer determines its top ten records in a way that's very similar to the mapper. Because we configured our job to have one reducer using `job.setNumReduceTasks(1)` and we used `NullWritable` as our key, there will be one input group for this reducer that contains all the potential top ten records. The reducer iterates through all these records and stores them in a `TreeMap`. After all the values have been iterated over, the values contained in the `TreeMap` are flushed to the file system in descending order.
   ```java
public static class TopTenReducer extends Reducer<NullWritable, Text, NullWritable, Text> {
  // Stores a map of user reputation to the record
  // Overloads the comparator to order the reputations in descending order
  private TreeMap<Integer, Text> repToRecordMap = new TreeMap<Integer, Text>();

  public void reduce(NullWritable key, Iterable<Text> values, Context context) throws IOException, InterruptedException {
    for (Text value : values) {
      repToRecordMap.<FILL IN>;

      // If we have more than ten records, remove the one with the lowest reputation
      if (repToRecordMap.size() > 10) {
        <FILL IN>
      }
    }

    for (Text t : repToRecordMap.descendingMap().values()) {
    // Output our ten records to the file system with a null key
      context.write(NullWritable.get(), t);
    }
  }
}
   ```

### The Input Data
The input file, `users.xml`, is in XML format with the following syntax:
   ```xml
<row Id="-1" Reputation="1"
  CreationDate="2014-05-13T21:29:22.820" DisplayName="Community"
  LastAccessDate="2014-05-13T21:29:22.820"
  WebsiteUrl="http://meta.stackexchange.com/"
  Location="on the server farm" AboutMe="..;"
  Views="0" UpVotes="506"
  DownVotes="37" AccountId="-1" />
   ```
The file is in the `topten/data` folder.
